Main project built in the context of Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in Paris.
This app is Airbnb typeof website, but renting vineyards.
A user can be a winemaker, thus being able to put their vineyard up for rent, as well as look for someone else's vineyard to rent.
Otherwise the user can just be searching for a rental vineyard.
However this website doesn't quite handle transactions, it was just training.
